IoT, or the Internet of Things, refers to the network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data with each other over the internet. These devices can range from everyday objects like home appliances, wearable devices, and industrial machines to vehicles and more. The primary goal of IoT is to enable these devices to collect and share information, making them "smart" and enhancing their capabilities.

Cyberattack and anomaly detection are growing concerns in the Internet of Things (IoT). With fast-growing deployment and opportunities, an increasing number of attacks put IoT devices under the threat of continuous exploitation and danger. Malicious operation, denial of service, MITM, and scan are major types of attacks that can cause IoT devices to fail. We study how a variety of machinelearning algorithms analyze and predict network attacks on IoT devices.
